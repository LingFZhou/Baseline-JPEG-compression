虽然体积很小\NThough it's relatively small,

60
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,566
但其火山活动与地球毫不相同\NEnceladus is different from the volcanism that's here on Earth

61
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:43,336
地球上的火山从地下喷射出\Nwhere hot magma, which is basically molten rock,

土卫二着实吸引住了我们关注\NEnceladus has really caught our imagination recently

70
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,976
虽然卫星南极间歇冰泉非常普遍\Nbecause we see geysers coming out of the south pole.

00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:24,886
我们想探究它如此活跃的原因\Nand it's active and we want to know why.

76
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,486
科学家计算得出土卫二南极\NScientists have counted at least 30 geyser jets

82
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:56,856
使"老虎条纹"常年保持高温\Nmay be due to the upwelling of water vapor that propels the jets.

83
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:04,946
有类似奇观的地方就是\NOne of the few other places to witness truly fascinating wonder,

或是电影拍摄场地\Nor on a movie set.

87
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,796
看看这台造雪机器\NLook at this snowmaking machine.

88
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:27,926
就像土卫二上的间歇冰泉\NIt's like a geyser from Enceladus.

89
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:31,496
喷出的冰粒和水珠\NAll these ice particles and water droplets

90
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:35,086
遇到外界空气后冻结成冰\Nfreeze when they encounter that outside air,

91
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:38,646
膨胀的气体也会使水珠冷却\Nand the expanding gases also help cool the dropls

92
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,856
最后冻结成冰\Nand freeze them.

93
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:42,026
在土卫二上\NIn the case of Enceladus,

94
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:45,896
液态水在地底空间内加热\Nheated liquid water in a cauldron below the surface

95
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:50,176
随后从南极火山口喷涌而出\Ngoes squirting out through some vents in the south polar region.

96
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,986
水喷射出来\NAnd when that water comes out

97
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:55,406
进入外界低温环境\Nand encounters the cold surrounding space

98
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:59,256
就会冻结  形成雪花和冰粒\Nit freezes, forming snowflakes and ice particles,

99
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:02,546
就像这些造雪机造出来的雪一样\Nmuch like the ones coming out of this snowmaking machine.

100
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:06,966
所以我现在就像在土卫二上一样\NSo wow, I might as well be on Enceladus right now.

101
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:16,016
科学家认为土卫二上有2个内部热源\NScientists think there must be two internal heat sources

102
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:19,266
才会形成这种冰火山\Ndriving this icy volcanism on Enceladus.

103
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:23,186
第一个热源是放射性元素\NOne source could be radioactive elements

104
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,636
其衰变后会加热内部温度\Nthat decay and heat up the interior,

105
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:28,936
从而保持水的液体形态\Nthereby keeping the water in a liquid state.

106
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,026
第二个就是潮汐加热\NThe second could be tidal heating.

107
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:38,336
假设土卫二就像这个气球\NSuppose Enceladus is like this squishy balloon.

108
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:42,976
土卫二以椭圆偏心轨道\NNow Enceladus orbits Saturn in a slightly elliptical,

109
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,646
围绕土星运动\Neccentric orbit.

110
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,696
有时离土星较近\NSo sometimes it's closer to Saturn,

111
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:49,166
有时离土星较远\Nsometimes it's farther away.

112
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,936
当距离较近时\NWhen it's close to Saturn,

113
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,716
土星的引力\NSaturn's gravitational pull

114
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:57,736
对土卫二形成潮汐引力作用\Ncreates a greater tidal stretching of Enceladus

115
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,606
距离较远时就不会有这种现象\Nthan when Enceladus is farther away.

116
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,736
潮汐引力作用\NThat leads to a rubbing

117
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,736
使卫星内部失去平衡\Nof the interior materials

118
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,436
因此释放出能量\Nand a release of energy.

119
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,456
这种潮汐力\NThis tidal friction, as it's called,

120
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:12,876
促使土卫二内部融化\Nhelps melt the interior of Enceladus

121
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:16,796
从而使水保持液态或半液体形态\Nand keep the water in this molten or partly molten state.

122
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,986
另一个未解之谜\NOne mystery is,

123
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:25,376
就是土卫二地表下储存有多少水\Nhow much water actually exists beneath the surface.

124
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,776
这个小型卫星下\NCould the miniature moon

125
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:30,666
会不会隐藏着一个海洋\Nbe hiding an underground ocean?

126
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,886
我们推断地下有一个液态海洋\NWe infer that there is a liquid ocean

127
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,616
因为间歇性冰泉必须要有水源\Nbecause there needs to be a source of water to power these geysers.

128
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,076
海洋可能没有遍布\NThe ocean may not extend

129
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,986
整个土卫二的内部\Nunder the entire globe of Enceladus.

130
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:44,996
可能只存在于间歇冰泉所在的区域\NIt may be just beneath these regions where the geysers are going off,

131
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:46,456
格瑞格・拉夫林\N加州大学  圣克鲁兹分校

132
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:46,886
但肯定的是\Nbut there has to be

133
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,886
土卫二冰层下应存在\Na significant reservoir of liquid water

134
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,556
一个重要的"地下水库"\Nbeneath the surface of Enceladus.

135
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,998
如果土卫二地表下真的存在液态水\NIf liquid water exists beneath the surface,

136
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:59,626
其中可能蕴含着大量有机分子\NIt could be teeming with organic molecules.

137
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:01,946
有机分子以及适宜温度\NThese, along with relatively warm temperatures,

138
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:06,566
都是创造生命的重要因素\Nare the essential ingredients for creating life.

139
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,366

我们无从知晓这些光环起源\NWe really don't know their origin.

168
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,546
也许由于土星重力作用\NThey may consist of material

使它们无法相互撞击\Nthat never had a chance to form into a moon

这属于反气旋\NIt's anticyclonic,

275
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:37,296
这是因为木星上是高气压系统\Nand that's because it's a high pressure system,

这个远古风暴团的起源\NThe origin of this long-lived storm

282
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,996
使天文学家们深表疑惑\Nhas baffled astronomers.

283

但现在  这个风暴团的神秘面纱\NBut now, science may be on the verge

284

三年后\NWithin three years,

290
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:15,106
这三个白斑相互融合\Nthe three white spots merged

291
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:18,886
形成一个与地球大小相同的风暴团\Nto form one Earth-size storm.

292
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:21,766
然后  出乎所有人预料\NThen, the unexpected happened.

293
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,526
仅过了一周\NOver the course of only about a week,

294
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:28,736
风暴团就从白色转变成亮红色\Nthe storm turned from white to bright red.

295
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,886
我们称之为椭圆二号\NIt's now known as Oval BA

有时也称为小红斑\Nor sometimes Red Junior.

297

小红斑

298
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:33,226
它为何会变红\NWhy it turned red

299

现在还无从知晓\Nis still a mystery.

301
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,546
现在天文学家怀疑类似的合并\NAstronomers now suspect a similar merger

302
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:46,886
可能就是大红斑的成因\Nmay have also created the Great Red Spot.

303
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,886
这过程与小红斑相似\NAnd like red junior,

304
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:52,666
猛烈的风暴团最初呈现白色\Nthe ferocious storm may have originally been white.

大红斑为何成砖红色\Nwhy the red spot has its characteristic Brick red color,

313
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:13,166
也许是其中的化合物\Nbut probably there are chemical compounds

从而形成了这种颜色\Nand are giving it this color.

316

关于这片小行星堆的起源\Nabout the origin of this cosmic junkyard of wayward debris,

很长一段时间内\NFor a long time

336
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,946
我们都以为\Nwe thought that, maybe, there had been

是某颗星球爆裂形成的\Na planet there that got pulverized,

是某场大灾难的遗迹\Nqnd we were just seeing the debris of some major catastrophe.

339
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,966
我们现在逐渐意识到\NBut we pretty much now realize

340
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:43,536
在那片区域不可能存在行星\Nthat a planet never was able to form there.

341
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,646
来自木星和其它星球的引力\NThe gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other planets

342
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:50,816
不可能让物质合成新行星\Njust made it impossible for material to coalesce into a planet.

343
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:56,326
在这片一亿英里宽的小行星带中\NWe traverse through 100 million miles of rocks,

344
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,546
有的小行星直径只有几英尺\Nsome as small as several feet,

有的直径比城市还大\Nothers bigger than cities.

346
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:07,556
这片区域可能含有数百万的小行星碎片\NThe belt probably contains millions of rocky pieces.

347
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,856
然而  如果所有的小行星\NYet, if all the asteroids

被压缩成一个整体的话\Nwere condensed into one boulder,

可能比月球还小\Nit would be smaller than our Moon.

350
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,666
研究这些小行星\NWe can start to learn more about

351
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,256
有助于帮我们了解\Nthe history of our Solar System

太阳系的起源\Nby studying the small bodies in our Solar System: the Asteroids.

353
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:25,296
我们希望了解它们是如何运行的\NWe'd like to know how they moved around,

354

如何受巨大行星影响\Nhow were they affected by the giant planets,

355
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:29,296
还有它们最终命运会如何\Nand what is their ultimate fate?

356
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:32,386
会变成什么形态\NWhat will happen to them?

陨石\NMeteorite!

358
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,626
商业电影中小行星带被描绘成\NPopular movies have portrayed the Asteroid Belt

在这里太空船需要闪避巨大陨石\Na place where spaceships dodge enormous boulders

陨石在坠入大气撞击地球之前\Nthat constantly collide and jostle for position

会不断互撞而争夺轨道\Nbefore hurtling down from space to destroy planet Earth.

363
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,286
但好莱坞电影描述的正确吗\NBut has Hollywood gotten it wrong?

364
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:58,166
小行星带有多么拥挤\NHow congested is the Asteroid Belt?

365
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:03,266
这是一位观众最想知道的宇宙秘密\NThat's what one viewer wanted to ask the universe.

366

密苏里州肯萨斯市的乔・T.向我们发来短信\NSo Joel T. From Kansas City, Missouri texted us...

367

感谢乔的提问\NThanks for the question, Joel.

369

我知道这有点震惊\NI know this is a bit shocking,

370
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:18,126
但大多数商业电影\Nbut the Asteroid Belt hasn't always been portrayed

371
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,846
对小行星带的描绘有严重偏差\Nterribly accurately in most blockbuster movies.

372
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:22,416
如果你在太阳系小行星带中\NIf you were orbiting an asteroid

你无法察觉\NYou wouldn't be able to see

事实上  它们看上去\NIn fact, they probably look

就像是星星点点的灯火\Njust like distant points of light.

379
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,046
因为小行星带中绝大多数小行星\NThat's because the average separations

00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,988
小行星带\Nthe Asteroid Belt.

425
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:02,136
这些远古遗物曾被搬上大银幕\NThis band of leftover debris has even made it to the big screen,

426
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:08,676
最令好莱坞着迷的\Nand the rocks Hollywood is obsessed with the most

427
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,806
是那些脱离小行星带\Nare those that escape the Asteroid Belt

428
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,276
撞击地球的天外陨石\Nand head for planet Earth.

429
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,186
近地天体是指\NNear-Earth Objects or NEOs

430
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,186
几乎每天都光临地球的\Nare cosmic rocks like asteroids or comets,

431
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:31,676
外太空岩石  例如小行星或者彗星\Nwhich strike Earth almost every day.

432
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,956
我们确实对近地天体很感兴趣\NWe're really very interested in Near-Earth Objects,

433
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:39,148
关注那些穿过地球公转轨道的天体\Nobjects that pass across the orbit of the Earth around the sun

434
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:44,248
因为它们撞击地球的几率非常大\Nbecause occasionally they can and do collide with the Earth,

435
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:45,668
艾力克斯・菲利潘科\N加州大学  伯克利分校

436
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:49,148
如果足够大  则可能对地球造成大面积破坏\Nand if they're big enough they can cause vast destruction here on Earth.

437
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:54,928
2010年4月14日\NOn April 14, 2010,

438
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:58,628
有镜头捕捉到一直径三英尺的小行星\Ncameras caught sight of a 3-foot fiery asteroid

439
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,598
从美国中西部天空呼啸划过\Nstreaming over the Midwestern United States.

440
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:06,268
幸运的是  在它撞到地面前\NFortunately, the cosmic rock broke into tiny pieces

441
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,058
就已碎裂成小块\Nbefore hitting the ground.

442
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:11,348
但在过去\NBut in the past,

443
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,698
美国  亚利桑那州

444
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,218
小行星撞击曾形成巨大陨坑\Nlarge asteroid impacts have created gigantic craters,

445
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:16,328
澳大利亚西部

446
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:18,378
加拿大  魁北克

447
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,658
甚至导致了大规模物种灭绝\Nand even triggered mass extinction events

448
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:25,928
比如导致恐龙灭绝的希克苏鲁伯小行星\Nlike the Chicxulub asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs.

449
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,908
在过去的十多亿年中\NOver the last billions of years,

450
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:33,288
地球被大小不一的小行星撞击过无数次\NEarth has been hit many times by asteroids of various sizes.

451
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:37,368
大约6500万年前\NThe impact that occurred roughly 65 million years ago

452
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,908
格瑞格・拉夫林\N加州大学  圣克鲁兹分校

453
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,338
一颗直径大约大约六英里的的小行星\Nthat perhaps wiped out the dinosaurs

454
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:42,728
撞向了今日墨西哥的区域\Nwas an example of something that was about six miles across

455
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,008
促使恐龙灭亡\Nthat slammed into, what is now Mexico,

456
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,338
对全球造成了难以想象的影响\Nand caused huge global ramifications for the Earth.

457
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:56,438
目前  一系列最新太空研究\NA number of new space surveys are currently tracking

458
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:57,868
正在追踪\Nall Near-Earth Objects

459
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:01,228
所有足以摧毁一座现代城市的近地天体\Nthat are large enough to destroy a modern city,

460
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:05,558
其中一些甚至会导致全球性大灾难\Nor even worse, ignite a global catastrophe.

461
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:15,498
我们已经追踪了所有直径超过一英里\NWe know of most of the objects that are larger than a mile

462
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,728
而且运行轨道可能与地球相交的天体\Nthat can intersect the Earth's orbit,

463
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:19,398
现在的目标是\Nand so the effort now is going in to

464
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:22,348
定位那些体育场大小的天体\Nfinding these sort of stadium-sized objects,

465
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:25,148
虽然不足以毁灭地球\Nthat while not completely devastating to the entire Earth,

466
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,768
但仍会对地球造成巨大影响\Nwould be a huge deal if they hit the Earth.

467
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,208
我们将小行星带留在身后\NAs we leave behind the Asteroid Belt,

468
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:44,748
驶向七大奇迹的下一站\Nwe chart a course to the next of our seven wonders,

469
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:51,688
第三奇观\Nnumber three...

470
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:54,248
火星奥林帕斯山\NOlympus Mons.

471
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:57,678
太阳系中最大的火山\Nthe largest volcano in the Solar System.

472
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,208
离火星越来越近\NAs we approach the planet mars,

473
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:12,278
这座硕大无朋的山体立刻吸引了我们的注意\Nwe immediately catch sight of this mammoth mountain.

474
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:17,448
山体底部直径大约350英里\NThe base of it is about almost 350 miles across,

475
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,238
这段距离相当于\Nthat's, as though, the base of the mountain

476
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:22,368
从洛杉矶到旧金山\Nwere from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

477
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:24,808
所以虽然海拔很高\NSo even though it's so high,

478
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,608
但是坡度很平缓\Nthe slope is very gradual.

479
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,268
你几乎无法察觉自己在爬山\NYou would barely know you were climbing a mountain.

480
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:33,708
劳拉・丹丽\N格里菲思天文台

481
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:32,228
它不是陡峭的火山\NIt's not like a steep volcano,

482
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:35,658
坡度很平缓\NIt's just... It's a smooth, low slope,

483
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:39,338
但是仿佛没有尽头\Nbut it just goes on forever.

484
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:43,938
奥林帕斯山位于塔尔西斯高地\NOlympus Mons is located in the Tharsis Bulge,

485
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:50,158
在那一地区还许多其他大型火山\Na region on the red planet that's home to other massive volcanoes.

486
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:53,908
如果你爬上13英里高的山顶\NIf you climb the 13 miles to its summit,

487
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:59,378
你可以看到火星大气的边缘\Nyou could take in a view of the very edge of the Martian atmosphere.

488
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:05,728
奥林帕斯山比地球最高峰高出许多倍\NOlympus Mons is several times higher than the highest mountains on Earth,

489
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:08,758
而山体底部更是方圆几百英里\Nand its base is hundreds of miles across.

490
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:11,468
在过去的数十亿年间\NAnd it's been formed over the last billions of years

491
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:14,328
经过一次又一次的火山喷发\Nby eruption after eruption after eruption,

492
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:18,368
由无数层的岩浆堆积而成\Nwhich has slowly surfaced it with successive layers of lava.

493
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:24,618
一亿年前  滚烫的岩浆从山顶喷涌而出\N100 million years ago, hot lava rivers poured down from its peak

494
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:29,028
覆盖了几百万平方英里的火星地表\Nto cover millions of square miles of the red planet.

495
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,978
坐落于夏威夷岛的莫纳罗亚山\NToday Olympus Mons is 100 times

496
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:36,748
是地球上最大的火山\Nthe volume of Earth's largest volcano, Mauna Loa,

497
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:39,628
如今的奥林帕斯山体积是它的100倍\Nlocated on the big island of Hawaii.

498
00:26:41,318 --> 00:26:45,268
奥林帕斯山比地球上的一切都大许多\NOlympus Mons got so much larger than anything here,

499
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:47,098
原因有许多\Nfor, well, a number of reasons.

500
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:50,488
有一点是肯定的  那里有很多的火山运动\NOne is certainly, there was just a lot of volcanic activity.

501
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:53,968
其二则是那里的重力小很多\NA second is that mare's gravity is much lower.

502
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:56,078
你在火星上的体重会轻许多\NYou weigh a lot less on mars.

503
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,508
所以随着山体的增高  它不会塌方\NSo as the mountain built up, it didn't compact back down.

504
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:03,798
火山可以堆积得很高而不崩塌\NIt was able to build up to a pretty huge volcano without collapsing.

505
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:09,178
第三点\NThe third and perhaps most important reason

506
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:11,568
也许是其如此巨大最重要的原因\Nwhy Olympus Mons is so huge

507
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,458
火星上没有板块构造\Nis that mars doesn't have plate tectonics,

508
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,478
不像地球\Nthe movement of crustal plates

509
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:20,798
熔融状地幔上方的地壳会发生运动\Nthat rest on top of the molten interior of bodies, such as Earth.

510
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:26,208
奥林帕斯山体积可以增长到如此巨大\NOlympus Mons grew to such a big size

511
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:30,738
因为火星上没有板块运动\Nbecause of the lack of tectonic motions on mars.

512
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:34,828
岩浆喷涌而出的地点\NThe hot spot from which the lava, the magma, emerged

513
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:37,328
始终不变\Nremained at one location,

514
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:40,648
这就可以堆积起越来越大山体\Nallowing more and more material to build up

515
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:43,538
形成一座超级火山\Nand create a super mountain, a super volcano.

516
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:51,108
火星现在被认为处于地质不活跃期\NMars is now presumed to be geologically inactive.

517
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,818
但是那火山猛兽是真的已死\NBut is the volcanic beast really dead

518
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:57,558
抑或仅仅还在休眠\Nor merely a sleeping giant?

519
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:06,058
欧洲航天局的火星快车号日前捕捉到了\NThe European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission recently captured

520
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,698
有史以来分辨率最高的岩浆流图象\Nthe highest resolution images ever taken of the planet's lava flows.

521
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:15,318
有些可以追溯到一亿多年前\NSome flows date back 115 million years,

522
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,828
但还有一些仅有200万年历史\Nbut others are only 2 million years old,

523
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:22,598
以地质时间刻度来看那是很短的时间\Nand on geologic time scales that's very recent,

524
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:27,228
也就意味着现在也许还有火山喷发\Nwhich suggests there still may be some volcanic activity.

525
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:30,198
如果看看奥林帕斯山表面\NIf we look at the surface of Olympus Mons,

526
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,618
我们能看到有一些岩浆流之上\Nwe see especially that there are lava flows,

527
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:34,698
几乎没有陨石坑\Nwhich have very few craters on them.

528
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,868
于是我们知道  这些岩浆流\NAnd so, we know that those lava flows are

529
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:40,628
最老也不过一两千万年\Nperhaps 10s-20 million years old at the oldest.

530
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:45,698
但是喷发运动一直在继续\NBut the eruptive activity has been going on

531
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:47,448
如果不是一直延续到了今天\Nuntil the relatively recent past,

532
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:50,258
那也是不久之前才停止的\Nif not right up until the present day.

533
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:59,988
奥林帕斯山也许曾经产生过大量的岩浆\NOlympus Mons may have once produced vast amounts of lava,

534
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:03,638
但那地狱烈焰般的热度\Nbut its hellish heat paled in comparison

535
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:06,268
与我们太阳系七大奇观\Nto the current temperatures

536
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:09,868
榜上第二名相比\Nof number two on our countdown

537
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:13,888
则是小巫见大巫了\Nof the seven incredible wonders of our Solar System.

538
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:18,058
它远看像是个大火球\NThis may look like a ball of flames.

539
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,038
其表面是温度高达一万度\NBut its surface is an ocean

540
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,498
等离子海洋\NOf 10,000-degree plasma

541
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:24,238
伴随着大风巨浪\Nwith waves, winds

542
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:25,678
以及大规模喷发\Nand massive eruptions

543
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:29,928
堪比十亿吨TNT炸药同时爆炸\Nas explosive as a billion tons of TNT.

544
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,918
下一个将要探究的太阳系奇观\NOur next wonder of the Solar System

545
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:44,988
既是地球的朋友  又是最大敌人\Nhas been Earth's best friend and foe.

546
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,858
它用光和热笼罩着我们的星球\NIt's bathed our planet with heat and energy,

547
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,939
但其释放的致命高能粒子波\NBut it's also blasted us with potentially deadly

548
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:56,589
也会伤害到我们\Nhighly energetic particles and waves.

549
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,849
我们继续探索第二奇观\NWe now navigate around number two:

550
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,169
极热的太阳表面\Nthe sizzling surface of the sun.

551
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:17,339
太阳表面相当杂乱无序\NThe surface of the sun is really quite chaotic.

552
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,139
它持续沸腾  不断冒泡\NIt's always boiling and bubbling.

553
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,329
还从太阳内部\NIn particular, there are hot cells of gas

554
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,599
释放出热能气体\Nthat come out from the interior up,

555
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,499
散发能量  逐渐冷却\Nradiate their energy, cool,

556
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,399
然后下沉回去\Nand then, come back down.

557
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,139
